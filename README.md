# BestHEIC – Browser-Based HEIC Converter

BestHEIC is a privacy-first web tool that converts HEIC/HEIF photos to JPG or PNG directly in your browser. No uploads. No tracking. No server processing.

## Why This Exists

Most HEIC converters require uploading your photos to third-party servers. BestHEIC runs entirely on your device using client-side JavaScript, so your files never leave your computer.

## Features

- Convert HEIC to JPG or PNG
- Runs 100% locally in the browser
- No file uploads
- No account required
- Works offline after first load

## How It Works

This project uses client-side JavaScript libraries to decode and convert HEIC images directly in the browser. All processing happens locally.
